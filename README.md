# ControlAccessLanguage

This was a project for creating a control access language. It is meant as an example of how a control language is designed and implemented. It is not meant to provide any sort of real world functionality.

Examples of how the access structure is defined that the language reads can be found in the ExampleStructures folder. The word document describes the language and defines the symbols it uses. The lanugage is based off of [SD3](http://trevorjim.com/projects/sd3/). More detailed information of the language, and specific features can be found in the word doc. There is also numercial analysis of the example files and some extrapolation on how the language would scale in larger systems.
